RefHell is a simple utility for .NET that can be used to analyze an assebly, and determine what other assemblies it depends on.

To use it, run the application and select a .NET assembly (.exe or .dll). The list of dependent assemblies will be displayed. Double-clicking on an assembly from the results box will show further details, including this assembly depends on it, and where the .NET framework ended up resolving it from (file path).

RefHell can also be used to run ILMerge.exe to combile multiple assemblies into one, however this support is incomplete, and somewhat limited at this time.
